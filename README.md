This is a custom Angular Video Player component. This project is just to playaround with the default video api by overriding its default controls and do quirky things with it.

## Quirky functionalitiesÂ 

### SPEECH CONTROL : Control the player through speech 
- The ability to control the video through speech.
- The video player has been enabled to be controlled using voice. Just press the 'microphone' icon and when (mic +) icon is shown, speak either of the following commands:
    - PLAY / START - To start the video
    - PAUSE / STOP - To pause the video
    - FULLSCREEN - Enable fullscreen
    - MUTE - Mute the video
    - VOLUME - Unmute the video
- Press the microphone button each time you want to speak a command
- For now the functionality is only available in chrome based browsers.

### CUSTOM CONTROL : Control the behavior of the player with custom buttons

- All prebuilt control buttons have been disabled, and custom buttons have been added.
