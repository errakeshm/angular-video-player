# Video Player

This is a custom Angular component encapsulating the HTML5 video api. This project is just to playaround with the default HTML5 video api by overriding its default controls and do quirky little things with it.

    - PLAY / START - To start the video
    - PAUSE / STOP - To pause the video
    - FULLSCREEN - Enable fullscreen
    - MUTE - Mute the video
    - VOLUME - Unmute the video
- Press the microphone button each time you want to speak a command
- For now the functionality is only available in chrome based browsers.
